# Raspberry-Pi-Collecting-Earthly-Reaction-to-Space-Weather
Space Weather affects us on earth. I intend to correlate as many local things as I can to what the Sun and Universe is throwing at us.
Space weather affects Earths Weather:
  Ionisphere,
  Cloud cover,
  Wind,
  Barometric pressure,
  Amount of moisture in the air,
  Radiation levels:
    Electromagnetism waves/particles at higher frequencies:
      IR,
      Visible light,
      UV,
      X-Rays,
      Gama Rays/Particles,
    Cosmic rays,
The Universe is sending us Plasma:
  Electrons,
  Ions,
Causing:
  Ground Currents,
  Lightning,
  Server Storms,
    Hurricanes,
    Tornadoes.
And the list goes on...
